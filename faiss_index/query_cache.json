In celestial mechanics these laws explain that planets and comets keep moving in space unless acted on by gravity, that the gravitational force determines their acceleration and orbital paths, and that the mutual gravitational forces between bodies are equal and opposite, producing the stable, elliptical motions observed in the heavens.",

    "query": "I have done an IVF for Rs 56,000. Is it covered?",
    "answer": "Yes, IVF is listed as an Assisted Reproduction Treatment (ART) that the policy can reimburse, but only if the policy’s specific conditions are met. The treatment must be started after the 36‑month waiting period, the plan must include the ART benefit (it is excluded only for plans that do not cover sterility/infertility), and the expense must be within the Rs 2 lakh limit (which Rs 56,000 is). If those conditions are satisfied, the Rs 56,000 IVF cost would be covered.",

    "query": "I did a cataract treatment of Rs 100,000. Will you settle the full Rs 100,000?",
    "answer": "No. The policy limits cataract surgery expenses to a sub‑limit – either 10 % of the sum insured with a maximum of Rs 50,000 per eye (or, in another clause, up to 25 % of the sum insured or Rs 40,000 per eye, whichever is lower). Therefore the full Rs 100,000 will not be paid; the claim will be settled only up to the applicable cataract sub‑limit.",
