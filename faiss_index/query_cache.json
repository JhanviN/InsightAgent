    "answer": "**Relevant excerpts from the document**\n\n1. **Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases**  \n   - “No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody **without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest** nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.”  \n\n2. **General protection of personal liberty**  \n   - “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty **except according to procedure established by law**.”  \n\n**Interpretation in relation to the question**  \n- The document states that a person who is arrested must be promptly informed of the grounds for the arrest and must be allowed to consult a lawyer of his choice.  \n- It does **not** specifically mention whether a warrant is required for an arrest. However, the requirement that the arrest be “according to procedure established by law” implies that any arrest (with or without a warrant) must follow the legal procedures prescribed by law.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \n- The document provides **partial information** relevant to the legality of an arrest (the need for procedural compliance and informing the arrested person of the grounds).  \n- It does **not** directly address the legality of an arrest **without a warrant**.  \n\n**Extracted text**  \n> “No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.”  \n\n> “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”",
